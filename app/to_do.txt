1) Get a dummy authenticate endpoint working. 
2) Create a get_user function that uses a fake sanity check
3) Replace the sanity check with a token that we get from either keycloak
or okta


Not using this flow anymore. The danger with this pattern is that it 
sends the auth token to the client. We would like to keep the token on the 
server side so that it is not exposed. 

Instead we will have a redirect that goes to our IAM provider. 

We will do an example for Keycloak and another for auth0. 


Ok lets get started.
